      "message": "I removed the two offending uses of empty() instead of isEmpty(). It still builds error free on Troika. I don\u0027t understand why this is needed here. If I undo ALL isEmpty replacements I get build errors. Why does it work in these places and not everywhere? I could just edit the files to change only the offending uses of .string and .isEmpty but that would need to be done for every device that uses these repos.",
